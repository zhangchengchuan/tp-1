### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteTask 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MmMainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `TaskListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MmMainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MmMainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MmMainWindow.java) is specified in [`MmMainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MmMainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Module` and `Task` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ManageMeParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddTaskCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteTask 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTask 1` Command](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClassesManageMe.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ManageMeParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddTaskCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddTaskCommand`) which the `ManageMeParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddTaskCommandParser`, `DeleteTaskCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageme/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/MMModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* store the object data of ManageMe i.e., all `Module` and `Task` objects (which are contained in a
  `UniqueModuleList`
  object
  and a `UniqueTaskList` respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[comment]: <> (<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative &#40;arguably, a more OOP&#41; model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/MMStorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ManageMe data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ManageMeStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes


Classes used by multiple components are in the `manageme.commons` package.

### Time component

[comment]: <> (**API** : [`Storage.java`]&#40;https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java&#41;)

<img src="images/MMTimeClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Time` component,
* is used as a standalone component to facilitate the tracking of time.
* enables notifications by comparing tasks' start and end time with system time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

The user can type `archive data` to archive the data, which creates a new empty data file for the current manageme gui and saves the old data files. User may also type `choose data {data_file_name}` to choose the data file that manageme currently reads.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

A Digital-Age student who...
* Needs to organize multiple tasks (events, tasks and deadlines), some of them involve computer files stored locally.
* Needs to organize multiple modules with many links to relevant online resources.
* Prefers visualizing all tasks and modules on a calendar for clear and quick presentation.
* Prefers desktop application over mobile application.
* Prefers typing over the use of mouse.
* Comfortable with the use of Command Line Interface (CLI).

**Value proposition**:
* Manage modules and tasks faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
* Manage multiple web links and file paths associated with modules and tasks.
* Summarises crucial information clearly such as:
    1) Tasks due Today and
    2) Upcoming Events on the Calendar

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system will not be responsible for checking the validity of external links entered into the system, such as Zoom links or Luminus links. They must be checked beforehand by the user.
